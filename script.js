// Static Methods and Properties

// There is only one Governor in the state, add static methods and properties you'd expect a Governor to have.

// log the properties and test the methods (don't instantiate)


// Thinking about a governor's properties:
// the particular state the governor is in.
// the political party the governor is of.

// Thinking about a governor's methods:
// signing legislation
// vetoing legislation
// preparing state budget
// administernig state budget
// implementing state laws

// Ok, but after some research on static properties and methods,
// these are properties and methods that are particular to the class
// itself, not on any instance.  static properties and methods, are
// not available to instances of the class.

// So we need to think about what is particular to the class Governor as a whole, that wouldn't be applicable to a particular governor of a particular state.  

// hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm

// .... after some more researching on static methods and properties
// need to review a little more.

// how about a static property for political party that only
// allows a governor to have possiblity of Republican, Democrat, Independent,
// Libertarian, Green, or other?

// I'm not sure if that's a good example or not right now
// But a method to COMPARE governor's might be a good reason to define
// a static method for a class.

// We could compare the election dates of governors, for example.
// To answer a question of how much longer a certain governor has held
// office than other one, for example.

// Another thing we could compare is the GENERAL location that
// a governor is located in.  Obviously they are located in different states
// but 2 governors might be in the Southwest, or one might be in the North, and
// another might be in the Southeast. or Midwest.
