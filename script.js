// Static Methods and Properties

// There is only one Governor in the state, add static methods and properties you'd expect a Governor to have.

// log the properties and test the methods (don't instantiate)


// Thinking about a governor's properties:
// the particular state the governor is in.
// the political party the governor is of.

// Thinking about a governor's methods:
// signing legislation
// vetoing legislation
// preparing state budget
// administernig state budget
// implementing state laws

// Ok, but after some research on static properties and methods,
// these are properties and methods that are particular to the class
// itself, not on any instance.  static properties and methods, are
// not available to instances of the class.

// So we need to think about what is particular to the class Governor as a whole, that wouldn't be applicable to a particular governor of a particular state.  

// hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm
